   Introductory information for the Unix talker code Amnuts (version 2.3.0)
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Welcome to the Amnuts talker code, version 2.3.0!  Or, if you have already
used Amnuts, then welcome back!  This is the latest version of Amnuts and MANY
things have changed.  If you are already familiar with Amnuts then you may want
to skip down to the next section, else please keep reading.

What is Amnuts?  Well, I'm going to guess that if you have this code then
you've been to the website and have read all about what Amnuts is, and know
it's what you want (or think it's what you want, and you're just trying it
out.)  So I won't go over details again.  Just check out the website
(http://amnuts.talker.com/) for full information.

Please read the 'IMPORTANT' file, and the 'amnuts_changes' in the DOCs
directory for more information on what changes have been made since
version 2.2.1 (the previous release to this one) because there have been a
LOT of them!  Even if you are a previous Amnuts user, programmer, owner,
whatever - you should STILL READ THE FILES! :)

I've put a fair amount of time into Amnuts (well, actually, I've put shit
loads of time into it... Why beat around the bush, huh?), its documents and
the website, so I would appreciate it if you don't add a few small commands
and then think that gives you the right to rename the code.  This is very
unfair and, I think, pretty damn disrespectful of the amount of time that
has been put into giving you this code free, and also providing you with
documents and the website.  The same goes for if you nick bits of the code
to put into your own talker - a mention in the credits of where the code
came from would be nice!  Especially if it's a feature you don't find on
anything else other than Amnuts, or is obvious it came from Amnuts.  Please
see the COPYRIGHT information for more information.

The above was the only bitch part that I needed to do.  Other than that, I
hope that you enjoy the code, and if you have any questions or comments,
ideas or bug reports then please feel free to email me.  The address you can
do that to is shown below.  

Thanks for using Amnuts!  Enjoy!
